# Arduino thermostat

I live in a 100 old building close to the center of Prague, Czech Republic. My landlord did a great job at restoring the apartment but unfortunately he was only able to install a simple electric heater in each room. They're comletely independent and there's no thermostat or any other way to regulate the temperature in the room.

I wanted more, so I bought a smart plug so I can control it remotely. It's a [TP-Link HS100](https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-5516_HS100.html) and it can be controlled over the network, even online with a [dedicated mobile app](https://www.tp-link.com/us/kasa-smart/kasa.html).

This already was a huge improvement, but it still wasn't quite there. Soon I realized that what I'm missing is a way to automatically regulate temperature in the room, i.e. a thermostat. Thus, this project was born.
